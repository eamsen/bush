Bush - Strategic Voting
by Eugen Sawin <sawine@me73.com>


Requirements
------------
  * POSIX.1b-compliant operating system (librt)
  * GNU GCC 4.6 or newer
  * GNU Make
  * Python 2.7 or newer (only for style checking)


Dependencies
------------
  * gflags (included)
  * cpplint (included, only required for style checking)
  * gtest (not included, only required for testing)
  * gperftools (not included, only required for profiling)


Building gflags
---------------
  Before building Bush, you need to build gflags locally once:
  $ make gflags

  Alternatively you can build all dependencies at once:
  $ make depend


Building Bush (depends on gflags)
--------------------------------
  To build Bush use:
  $ make

  For performance tests use the more optimised version:
  $ make opt


Testing Bush (depends on gtest)
------------------------------
  To build and run the unit tests use:
  $ make test


Profiling Bush (depends on gperftools)
--------------------------------------
  To build Bush with profiling turned on use:
  $ make profile


Checking style
--------------
  To test code style conformance with the Google C++ Style Guide
  (http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.xml) use:
  $ make checkstyle


Using Bush
---------
  $ bush <preferences.vote> <voter id> <voting system>

  To show the full usage and flags help use:
  $ bush -help

  Do not like Bush? Bush is kind enough to make a copy of himself called vote.
